QualityBots is a tool that allows users to create batch webpage comparisons across Chrome channels by utilizing EC2 machines. The resulting comparisons will help webpage designers and Chrome app developers understand how their work will fare in future Chrome versions.  In this way, one can be well prepared for change and handle it in a timely fashion.

QualityBots utilizes both App Engine and Amazon EC2.
